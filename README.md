## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Animations and transitions

### Continued development

For future plans for now its to do more and more javascript. I just recently finished a course for it and i want to use my new hand skills and make amazing projects. I am super glad frontend mentor exists. I might study a framework or start a little bit on the backend. In fact i was considering looking up a few videos on using Figma and learn how to design proper websites.
